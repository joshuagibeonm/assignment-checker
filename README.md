# assignment-checker
An absurd project made by Joshua Gibeon.

The purpose of this script is to automatically check the student's assignment for my job in University, so i don't need to check them all one by one by hand. Feel free to clone or use this script!

# Details
1. This script takes one parameter, used to write title of the assignment in scoresheet.log.
2. This script use answer.cpp as its answer's source, write your correct code here!
3. Put all of your test case in 'testcase' folder, this script will automatically reads all it's input and then put the correct out from each testcase in 'answer' folder, and then test all the student's assignment.
4. Filename format for student's assignment file that used in this script is [BLAHBLAH_{studentsId}.cpp], put them all in 'filelist' folder.
5. Check the scoresheet.log to get all the student's score! I use [{studentId}-{Score}/{maxScore}] format.
